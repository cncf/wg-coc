# Code of Conduct Working Group

## Purpose

The CNCF Code of Conduct Working Group (“CoC-WG” or “Working Group”) is a working group whose intended output is an updated CoC incident resolution structure and updated set of policy documents including:
-  **[Updated CNCF Code of Conduct]:** This document will contain improvements to the existing CNCF Code of Conduct and will eventually replace the existing CNCF Code of Conduct.
-  **[CNCF Code of Conduct Committee Description]:** This document will describe the size, composition, eligibility requirements, term lengths, procedures for electing or appointing the committee members, and decision-making processes.
-  **[Incident Resolution Procedures]:** This document will explain how to submit a report, policies regarding information sharing and confidentiality, how conflicts of interest are dealt with, and other procedures related to review, investigation, and resolution of an incident.
-  **Jurisdiction and Escalation Policy:**  This document will explain how to determine whether an incident falls under the jurisdiction of LF Events, the CNCF CoC Committee, or a project-level CoC Committee.

The Working Group will **not** review or resolve Code of Conduct complaints.  Resolution of Code of Conduct incidents will continue to be handled by the [Interim CNCF Code of Conduct Committee](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/committee/) until a more permanent committee structure results from the output of the Working Group.

## Roadmap of Priorities

The Working Group intends to complete its intended deliverables in the following order:
1. [Updated CNCF Code of Conduct]
1. [Incident Resolution Procedures]
1. [CNCF Code of Conduct Committee Description]
1. Jurisdiction & Escalation Policy

## Working Group Leadership

The Working Group has 3 Co-Chairs and primary Approvers: one from the Governing Board, one from the TOC, and one who is elected by the Maintainer community.  The Governing Board, TOC, and Maintainer community each also have a designated alternate Approver.

If you would like to become a Reviewer, please open a pull request to add yourself to the Reviewer list above.

## How Decisions Are Made

The review and approval process is structured to ensure that the Working Group is making decisions based on consensus and that there is broad buy-in on any proposal that gets merged.

Initially, at least 3 Reviewers must review and support a PR for it to advance to the Approvers, and all 3 Approvers (1 from the Governing Board, 1 from the Technical Oversight Committee, and 1 Approver who has been elected by the community) must approve in order for the pull request to be merged.

Additionally, updates to the Code of Conduct itself must be approved by the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (CNCF Charter §13), and creation of the new CoC Committee must be approved by the CNCF Governing Board (CNCF Charter §5(d)(vii)).

In the event consensus is not reached on any particular issue in order to move forward in accordance with the review and approval procedures described above, the issue will be escalated to CNCF Governing Board if it concerns matters related to the structure, policies, or procedures of the Code of Conduct Committee; and the issue will be escalated to the Technical Oversight Committee if it concerns the language of the Code of Conduct itself.

For any major new proposal, the Approvers/Co-Chairs will allow a comment period of at least two weeks before approving or merging it.
