# CNCF Code of Conduct Committee Charter

## Purpose

The CNCF Code of Conduct Committee (“CoC Committee”) responds to, investigates, and resolves [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) incidents.

The Jurisdiction Policy describes the CoC Committee’s relationship to the Linux Foundation (LF) staff, who enforces the [Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/), and project-level Code of Conduct responders (e.g., the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee).

## Composition and Selection of Committee Members

The CoC Committee consists of 3 community members and 2 CNCF staff members, plus alternates.

To be eligible to serve as a primary or alternate member of the CoC Committee, an individual must not have violated the CNCF Code of Conduct within the prior 18 months.

### Community Representatives

The community representatives will be selected as follows:

* The [Technical Oversight Committee](https://www.cncf.io/people/technical-oversight-committee/) (TOC) will appoint 1 primary representative and 1 alternate representative, each of whom must be a current or emeritus member of the TOC.
* [CNCF TAG Contributor Strategy](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/) will appoint 1 primary representative and 1 alternate representative, each of whom must be a current member of TAG Contributor Strategy.
* The Maintainers will elect 1 primary Maintainer representative and 1 alternate Maintainer representative, each of whom must be an active [Maintainer](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv) of an incubating or graduated CNCF project.

The Maintainer representatives will be elected by Maintainers in the same manner as the Developer Representatives on the CNCF Governing Board, per the [Maintainer Election Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/maintainers-election-policy.md), except that both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes Maintainers will vote together instead of separately, and the voting timeline shall adhere to the following requirements:
* The nomination period following a call for nominations shall last at least 7 days
* Ballots shall be distributed promptly (2 business days or less) afer the nomination period closes
* After ballots are distributed, Maintainers shall have at least 7 days to submit their votes

In the first election, 2 Maintainers shall be elected. The Maintainer with the highest number of votes shall serve as the primary Maintainer representative, and the runner up shall serve as an alternate. Maintainers shall have 2 year terms that are staggered so that only 1 of the Maintainer representative seats is up for election year. To enable staggered terms, the primary Maintainer representative elected in the first election shall have a term of 1 year. The term for each other Maintainer representative shall be 2 years, and the Maintainer representative shall serve as an alternate the 1st year of their term and as a primary committee member the 2nd year of their term. 

There is no limit on the number of terms an individual can serve on the CoC Committee. There will be no fixed terms for the TOC, CNCF TAG Contributor Strategy, or Governing Board representatives. The TOC and TAG-Contributor Strategy may replace their designated representatives at any time. However, for continuity, it is highly encouraged that each representative serve for a duration of 1 year or longer.

If any primary member of the CoC Committee is inactive on the committee for more than 6 months, it is highly encouraged that they resign, and if they do not resign, the remaining CoC Committee members may vote to remove them. If the individual who resigns is an elected Maintainer representative, the remaining CoC Committee members will decide whether to hold a special mid-cycle election to fill the vacancy or invite an alternate to fill the vacancy.

### CNCF Staff Representatives

CNCF will appoint 2 staff members to serve on the CoC Committee as primary representatives. 

CNCF may appoint up to 2 alternate staff members to serve on the committee on an ongoing basis. Alternatively, in the event one of the primary CNCF staff representatives is unavailable or has a conflict of interest for a particular incident, CNCF may appoint an alternate staff representative just for that incident.

## Alternates  

Alternates do not participate in resolution of every incident; alternates participate only on an as needed basis to when a primary committee member is unavailable or has a conflict of interest, for the purpose of ensuring that multiple Community Members participate in resolution of every incident.

In addition to the Governing Board alternates and the alternates described under [Community Representatives](#community-representatives), the primary members of the CoC Committee may invite any of the following to serve as an alternate, either on an ongoing basis or for a particular incident:

* Any current Graduated or Incubating [Maintainer](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv)
* Any current member of the CNCF End User Technical Advisory Board 
* Any current member of a CNCF End User Group
* Any current CNCF Ambassador
* The Chairperson or Vice Chairperson of the CNCF Marketing Committee

Any individual who serves as an alternate on an ongoing basis (rather than for a particular incident) shall be added to the list of Current Members of the CNCF Code of Conduct Committee.

## Linux Foundation Liaison

When a Code of Conduct incident is subject to both the CNCF Code of Conduct and the Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct, the Linux Foundation may designate a liaison (the “LF Liaison”) to coordinate efforts between the Linux Foundation and the CoC Committee. The LF Liaison may participate in CoC Committee discussions and meetings regarding the incident on a non-voting basis. The LF Liaison shall comply with the [Confidentiality Policy](https://github.com/cncf/wg-coc/blob/main/coc-incident-resolution-procedures-proposed.md#confidentiality-policy).

## CNCF Governing Board Liaison

The CNCF Governing Board shall designate a representative to serve as a liaison (the "GB Laison") to coordinate efforts between the Governing Board and CoC Committee when the CoC Committee deems such coordination to be in the best interests of the community. The GB Liaison shall not participate in the investigation (except as a witness if appropriate) or decision-making regading how an incident should be resolved. Types of information that the CoC Committee may provide to the GB Liaison include status of an investigation, number of reports received, general nature of a complaint, whether the CoC Committee itself is performing an investigation or whether an external consultant is performing the investigation, any systemic issues (e.g., policy, governance, or cultural concerns) related to the incident that the CoC Committee would like to make the Governing Board aware of, and other information that does not identify the reporters or other confidential information regarding specific incidents. Information that identifies a reporter or victim will not be provided to a GB Liaison unless the reporter, victim, or target of harassment has consented to dislosure of their identity, or their identity as the reporter, victim, or target of harassment is already publicly known. Additionally, the GB Liaison shall comply with the [Confidentiality Policy](https://github.com/cncf/wg-coc/blob/main/coc-incident-resolution-procedures-proposed.md#confidentiality-policy). The GB Liaison may share statistical or procedural information (e.g., number of incidents reported, how the CoC Committee functions, procedures being followed for resolution of an incident, etc.) with the Governing Board freely. The GB Liaison shall not share confidential information concerning any specific incident with the Governing Board unless the CoC Committee has requested or authorized such sharing for a purpose specified by the CoC Committee, and in such case the GB Liaison shall clearly designate such information as confidential when conveying such information to the Governing Board.

## How Decisions Are Made

Decisions of the CoC Committee shall be made by consensus whenever possible. In the event consensus cannot be reached, decisions shall be made by majority vote of non-conflicted members of the CoC Committee. A decision to take temporary interim action in the event of an emergency may be taken by any individual CoC Committee member acting in good faith, and the CoC Committee shall review such action and decide whether to confirm or reverse such action. Any permanent action shall require approval of a majority of non-conflicted members of the CoC Committee. The CoC Committee may take action without a meeting if a majority of non-conflicted members express agreement in writing (e.g., email or slack) and none of the non-conflicted CoC Committee members either object to the proposed action or request a meeting to discuss the proposed action within 24 hours after the action is first proposed to the CoC Committee. In the absence of such agreement in writing, the CoC Committee may only take action during or after a meeting takes place at which the proposed action is discussed and agreed to by consensus or voted upon by a quorum of the non-conflicted members. A majority of non-conflicted members shall be deemed a quorum for purposes of a meeting. See the “[Conflict of Interest](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/procedures/#conflicts-of-interest)” section of the Incident Resolution Procedures for more information.

## External Support Resources

The CoC Committee may, in its discretion, engage external mediators, investigators, advisors, and consultants as needed to assist with resolution of CoC Incidents. Any such external resources shall not have a vote, and shall be required to maintain confidentiality in accordance with our [Confidentiality Policy](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/procedures/#confidentiality-policy).
